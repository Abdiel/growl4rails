==============
 
Growl4Rails is a javascript component that provides the UI for growl-like notifications in your rails application.

This plugin requires Prototype 1.6 or higher and Scriptaculous 1.7 or higher.

Installation
===============

If you are on Rails 2.1 or higher:

$ script/plugin install git://github.com/jfiorato/growl4rails.git

For older versions of Rails, cd into your application's vendor/plugins, and execute the following:

$ git clone --depth 1 git://github.com/jfiorato/growl4rails.git
$ mkdir ../../public/javascripts/growl4rails ../../public/stylesheets/growl4rails ../../public/images/growl4rails
$ cp growl4rails/public/javascripts/* ../../public/javascripts/growl4rails/

Usage
=====

<%= growl4rails_includes %>

Then when you'd like the Growl window to appear:

<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  Growl.show("/images/download.png", "Foo Bar.pdf", "File is ready for download.");
</script>

Growl.show method takes 3 arguments:
